Avoid overspending resources on 2-3 star knights beyond level 50.\n‚ö° **Resource Management**:\n- **Stamina**: Save stamina for strategic pushes, especially near event end.\n- **Edicts & Books**: Distribute wisely among your chosen knights focusing on relevant attributes.\n- **Event Cards**: Save valuable cards (like double dice) for bonus windows.\n- **Gold**: Use gold to buy stamina, invest in and garrison buildings.\nü§ù **Alliance Collaboration**:\n- Participate in town construction by using stamina on the event map.\n- Attack higher-level alliance buildings for maximum points.\nüîç **Gameplay Tips**:\n- **Sabotage**: Move slowly to maximize stops and coins during sabotage; target key buildings like the courthouse.\n- **Raiding**: Prioritize raiding high-level buildings you land on.\n- **Knight Usage**: Use top knights for attacking rather than defense to maximize returns.\nü™ô **F2P Efficiency Tips** (from experienced players):\n- Prioritize **dice collection** (free dailies, store, alliance shop) to maintain consistent event activity.\n- Use **double dice strategically**, preferably when landing near high-value or key buildings.\n- Participate daily in **alliance building upgrades**, even with small stamina, to remain active.\n- **Do not overspend gold unnecessarily** unless targeting top milestones.\n‚ö†Ô∏è **Very Important Server Rules**:\n> üö´ **In cross-server Realm Revival events, DO NOT raid alliances from our server.**\n> üö´ If an alliance is chosen to win, do not raid it.
